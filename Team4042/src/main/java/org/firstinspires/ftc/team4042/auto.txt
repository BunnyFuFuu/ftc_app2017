#help: type x y speed time/distance
#type: d - dead-reckoning drive
#type: r - gyro rotation (x = -1 for counter-clockwise; 1 for clockwise) until distance
#type: s - sensor drive until ir returns distance
#ex:   d 1 .2 .5 1000 will drive right and slightly forward at half speed for 1000 encoder ticks
d 1 .2 .5 1000
